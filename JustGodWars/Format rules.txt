Every const, readonly static field has to be at the top.
Every private field is at the top if there aren't static member data.

After the fields, there are constructors. They sit after the fields, and before the properties and methods.

Every property sits after the constructor and before the Methods.

They are combined by logic. (ex. Start - End, etc).
